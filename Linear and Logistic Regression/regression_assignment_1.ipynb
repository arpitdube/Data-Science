This assumption is often assumed to be met if the data is collected through random sampling. We can also use autocorrelation plots to check for residual autocorrelation.\n",

We can plot the residuals against the predicted values or independent variables. If the spread of residuals widens or narrows as we move along the predicted values, this assumption may be violated. We can also use statistical tests like the Breusch-Pagan test or White's test to formally assess heteroscedasticity.\n",

In polynomial regression, interpreting individual coefficients can be more challenging, as they represent the impact of higher-order terms and their interactions.\n",
